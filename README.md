### MCM3000
Python 3 serial interface for Thorlabs MCM3000 Series 3-Axis Controllers. A fork of [amsikking/thorlabs_MCM3000](https://github.com/amsikking/thorlabs_MCM3000) to which I've added timeouts and made a few stylistic changes.

### Installation
`pip install MCM3000`

### Getting Started
Make sure the MCM3000 is connected to a COM port and compatible stages. See the [example](https://github.com/sstucker/MCM3000/blob/c8722ea3a8fefd9ec7b432705e2e3be2043909fb/MCM3000/MCM3000.py?plain=1#L231).
